Python Version - 3.6
Blackjack.py
* Python program to train the neural network.
* Will save the network to a file to avoid having to retrain the network everytime you want to use the network. 
* Default name for the network is “blackjack.h5” but can be changed by changing the variable “file_name” the name must end in .h5 for saving from keras. Changing the name you must also changing the loading name in the blackjack_player in order for the file to run with that network.
* Activations function is sigmoid for all of the hidden layers and relu for the output layer
Blackjack_simulator.py
* Python program to generate the training data needed to train the network
* Default value is set to 500,000 but can be altered by the variable “num_samples” 
* HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to leave this number at 500,000 because lower number of samples have cause results to be not be the best and often requires the training to run longer.
Blackjack_player.py
* Python program to play blackjack vs the dealer.
* Default runs 100,000 games but can be changed by changing the “num_games” variables. 
* If you changed the name of the network file from blackjack.h5 to anything else be sure to also change the load_model() to match the new name.
blackjack.h5
* A trained version of the neural network to play blackjack
* 104-100-100-256-1
blackjack_untrained.h5
* An untrained version of the network
* The network has a 104-100-100-256-1
TestingData.txt
* A text document containing the testing data used for this problem
* Specifically 12578 samples
TestingLabels.txt
* A text document containing the labels for the testing data
* A matching 12578 samples to the TestingData.txt
